				<h1>A game a day</h1>
				<h2>is a challenge I created for myself which was inspired by the talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9O9Q8OVWrFA">Game a Week: Teaching Students to Prototype</a> from Bennett Foddy and Douglas Wilson, where they talk about how their students have to create a game each week to get experience. I found this idea interesting and thought "Mhh? What could I do in a single day?", and tried it out a few times. To be exact, three times.</h2><br><br>

					<td><h2>Stuff the Fishy - Mini Game</h2>
						<h3>
						The goal of this mini-game is to catch the fishys in the pond for the frog monster. But controlling his hand and throwing the fishys in his mouth is not as easy as one might expect. <br> This is an actual fun mini-game, unlike the other two. It is downloadable <a href="https://captaintimbertim.itch.io/stuff-the-fishy">here</a>.

					<td><h2>Fishy Jump - Failed Mini Game</h2>
						<h3>
						In this mini-game you were supposed to control the fishy and jump through hoops. As the video shows it was not finished, as I got bogged down in making the camera follow the fishy in an interesting way. <br> That is something good to keep in mind. I could have just worked mostly on creating the actual game and using a simple follow or static camera and in the end try to make it fancy. But I focused on the wrong and unimportant part, which lead to an unfinished game. Lessons learned: First make the game work, then focus on the details!

					<td><h2>Flopp'm Fishy - Mini Game</h2>
<h3>In this mini-game, you have a pond with many fishys flopping around and a target circling around it. The goal is to hit the target with as many fishys as possible by throwing bombs in the pond.<br>The game is not that interesting or fun, but as a first trial was good enough. My favourite thing about it is the start screen, where I put the camera low to the ground and let the fishy bounce around. Fun to watch!<br>This game is also available on <a href="https://captaintimbertim.itch.io/floppm-fishy">itch.io</a>.
