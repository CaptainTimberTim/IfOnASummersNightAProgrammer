"...tries to think of a title for his new website."<br><br><br><br><br>

Welcome to my beautiful website. <br>
It is purposefully designed to make your viewing as pleasurable as possible and, more importantly, to show that I absolutely don't care about web-design/technologies. <br>
<br>
The main purpose of this website, at least for now, is to show off some projects I worked on. Originally for application purposes, but now just because I like having them here.<br>
<br>

Secret text: 
You read right after you arrive at the blog of a random programmer. How did you get here? Maybe you were searching the web for a book from the Italian author Italo Calvino, found this peculiar domain name and thought: "Is that a play on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_on_a_winter%27s_night_a_traveler">book title</a> I am searching for?", which prompted you to click on it and find out what would linger behind this -maybe- reference. <br>
No, you came here through different means. You are in charge of looking at applicants for the company you are working at, looked at this particular persons' r&eacute;sum&eacute; and found a link to his blog where he supposedly listed projects of his. The reference to the Italian author Italo Calvino was lost on you, maybe you never heard of him, or you heard of him, but only know him by name and not from reading his works. Quickly, before starting your lunch break in -what is it? 6 Minutes?- you want to finish going through his application and later decide who might be best suitable for the job. <br>

After a short loading -which is still way too long for the actual power of modern computers- the site appears and you are instantly disappointed. Green is not the color you would have chosen to define the dominant look of your blog, or is it? Maybe you like green as much as this programmer and are delighted that another person shares your enthusiasm -which at this point is already strange you think- on the color green. Do you think his aesthetics resonate with you? Or do you find his sense of design to be lacking something? Either way, as your eyes start to wander the page it is a certain simplicity you find, that dominates the page. Not much going on, which you like. In this fast, modern world and the internet with its ever-increasing busyness and advertisements everywhere, buttons which you never considered even clicking like "Bookmarks", or "Give Feedback" plastered in every corner, this change of pace pleases you. Or you find it rather outdated, "This looks like it comes straight out of the 90s, not a modern webpage at all!", you think. <br><br>
"Hello, Sailor!", you read. Another reference, but for what exactly? And to make it worse it is the landing page of the whole website. You ponder a few seconds on why the author of this site would do such a thing. "Home" would be much more fitting as the title for a landing page, one is bound to get lost on a website with an arbitrary naming scheme like this. Only a chaotic person, you predict, would do such a thing. Someone who does not think too hard about the consequences of such decisions. But then you consider that the naming at least makes some sense. It is a greeting after all, which indicates that you will get back to the entry point of the site when you click it while on a different sub-page. Additionally, you notice that the fact that the card is the leftmost one already makes it clear where you end up when clicking on it. After you formulated these thoughts you reconsider your impression of the author. Maybe you were too quick to judge, he may not have his head in the clouds after all. <br>
Now your eyes fall on the card titled "Projects", and you imminently remember what you came here for. Or not, because you stumbled upon the website. May it be so or not, what you now desire to know is what kind of projects the author might have done, that he finds worthy of showing off to the internet. It could be small stuff, maybe during his time at a university, where he had courses that required a final project -which had a specified theme given by the professor- to pass it. Similar to how it was for you now so many years ago. You think back, reminiscing the good old days. No, you don't. You never went to university and you think the projects that will be listed under the "Projects" card will be hobby projects. Like you had always done, before starting to work a 40 hour week with family and kids. Always starting new and exciting stuff, abandoning them after a few weeks when the first spark and the initial energy is lost and the drudge-work is all that is left. You secretly hope that it will be the same for him -unfinished projects- and that you will find that he also starts many things and never finishes them. After a moment you come to expect this not to be likely. Why would he show off unfinished work like that? No, that makes no sense to you. Unless, maybe, he wants to make exactly this point? Maybe he wants to show his growth by showing off the old, failed attempts and leading with the ones that did come out to be something? <br>
Now eager to find out you take the mouse back into your hand, move the cursor to the "Projects" card and click...
