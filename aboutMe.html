<br><br><br><br><h2><br>
Hello Tim, I want to know something about you.<br>
<br>
Q: Can I ask you a few questions?<br>
A: Yes, that's why we are here. Isn't it?<br>
<br>
Q: Ah, yes. Ok. Where were you born?<br>
A: In Bremen, Germany.<br>
<br>
Q: What are your hobbies?<br>
A: The most obvious would be programming. Secondly, I like playing computer games, as one might have expected.
I also do bouldering. A few years ago I picked up reading as a hobby as well. I never was a reader and wanted to change that, so I did. 
Lastly, I could mention listening to music and drawing. But is "listening to music" really a hobby? I do not know. And drawing is something I did a lot in the past, but the last few years not so much...<br>
<br>
Q: Bouldern? What exactly is that, is it just a different word for climbing?<br>
A: Well, not really. Bouldern is climbing, but without a rope. Because of that, the walls have a maximum height of 4 meters and soft mats are placed below it for a soft landing. <br>
The focus is more on having short, difficult routes where the fun is trying to overcome a hard section and trying again and again. Thats why these routes are also often called "problems". 
It is a form of problem solving, but more on a physical than an intellectual level.<br>
<br>
Q: You mentioned programming first. What do you program?<br>
A: Think about it, the whole purpose of this website is showing off my programming projects. Just look around and you will know.<br>
<br>
Q: True. Gaming, what is your favourite game?<br>
A: Some of my favourite games are, in no particular order, are The Witness, Minecraft, Dark Souls, The binding of Isaac, Hollow Knight, Opus Magnum, Deponia Trilogy, Return of the Obra Dinn, Shenzhen I/O, Super Mario World, Anno 1404, Dead Cells, Darkest Dungeon, Sekiro - Shadows die twice, and more I cannot think about right now.<br>
In general, I like difficult games, especially when they include genres like Action, Puzzle or Rougelike. I am not a big fan of shooter in general, and for no apparent reason. I like some shooter games, like Borderlands, but not many. And I am also not a big fan of strategy games. But as always there are exceptions for the rule. As the fact that Anno 1404 is on my list exemplifies. <br>
<br>
Q: The same questions for books.<br>
A: Im a big fan of Italo Calvino and my current favourite book is "If on a winter's night a traveller". I also really love "The Dark Tower" series by Stephen King. And one of the most difficult but also rewarding books I ever read was "Gravity's Rainbow" by Thomas Pynchon. The non-fiction books "The greatest story ever told - so far" by Lawrence M. Krauss and "God is not great" by Christopher Hitchens are also some of my favourites.<br>
<br>
Q: Music?<br>
A: I like many things, but my heart will always lean towards Rock and Metal music. But I also really like Blues and Jazz and Classical Music. <br>
My favourite artists right now are TOOL, Tom Waits, Metallica, Die Ã„rzte and System of a Down. <br>
<br>
A: That should be it for now. Maybe we can come back later and elaborate more on some topics. But for now that should be enough, thank you.<br>
Q: Thanks, bye.<br><br>
