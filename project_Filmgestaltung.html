					<h2>This was the final project of the bachelor studies course Movie Design, which was a team effort by me and two fellow students. We three together worked out the script and directed the movie on one rainy weekend with not much sleep. The cutting was also done together, but was on a rather short notice and we wanted to make a better cut at some point, but never did. Even with only 11 minutes runtime it drags on a bit too much.<br></h2>
