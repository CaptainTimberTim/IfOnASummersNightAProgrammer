				<h2>The thermal grill illusion is a sensory illusion where you feel intense heat when multiple alternating slightly warm and slightly cold pipes touch your skin. The idea of this project was to use this effect to simulate getting hit or taking damage in a VR setting (game or firefighter training). In addition to using only warm or cold to simulate normal temperature changes as well. <br><br>This project was a combined effort with a fellow student, but the written theses were two seperate things as we clearly seperated the work that was done. In the video the whole project is shown. The main parts I created where the design of the circuit board, programming of the microcontroller, evaluating which body parts to use and implementing the inverse kinematics as well as some other stuff in Unity. <br> If you are interested, you can download the thesis <a href="Downloads/TimDierksBachelorThesis.pdf" download>here</a> (german).</h2>
