				<h1>C/C++ Prototypes</h1><h2>All these prototypes use minimal amount of external code, that I did not write. The idea to start doing this came from <a href="https://hero.handmade.network/episode/code">HandmadeHero</a> by Casey Muratori, who is creating a game in C/C++ from scratch with no external libraries, on stream, in a very long running series.</h2><br><br>

					<td><h2>Image Viewer</h2>
					<h3>As you might have noticed, the new standard image viewer on Windows 10 is awful. It is buggy, slow and has problems displaying images with transparency. That is why I had the idea to create my own Image Viewer, with interesting features like a "Folder Overview" and other stuff. <br>The reason I stopped working on it, was the fact that the amount of work to only load most existing image types is insane. That was highly demotivating and the reason I stopped. But I found a replacement project, the <a href="project_hobby_MPlay3.html">Audio Player</a>, which does not have this problem.</h3></td>

					<td><h2>Hex map builder</h2>
					<h3>I am a fan of Pen'n Paper games like Dungeons and Dragons and wanted to make a cool and simple map builder for it. I took the liberty to use hex spaces instead of the normally used squares, because they have much more consistent properties with what you normally want to do in PnP games. Measuring distance for instance. <a href="">This</a> turorial is the quintessential reference, in my opinion, for hex field stuff. <br>It quickly became more than just a map builder, as I started to implement path finding and other stuff. Thus I stared some undefined PnP like game.<br>The reason I stopped was that I had the idea to implement rigid body physics for rolling dice. I stopped when I had some bug in the EPA/GJK algorithm I couldn't find and was busy with other stuff. Like that it faded out of my conscious mind and I stopped working on it.</h3></td>

					<td><h2>Game Prototype - Shader Test</h2>
					<h3>This is my first try at a game with no external code. I had some form of puzzle game in mind, but never overcame the initial setup phase for all the required engine stuff like input and graphics/GL/shader stuff. But I build on this foundation in the other projects I showed on this site.</h3></td>
