				<h2> Hello, <br>these are my hobby projects. I worked on them during my time at the University of Applied Sciences in Gelsenkirchen, Germany during my freetime, hence they are hobby projects...<br>
				The first two cards are single projects, because, well, they do not fit in one of the other categories. The first is the entry of a Hackathon I took part in. The second one is the MP3 player I am still working on right now, and which is the longest running hobby project I actually ever had. That is why I did not consider it part of the "C/C++ Prototype" card. More information on the specific project is on their respective page.<br><br>

				The last four cards are groups of projects that fit into these categories. The "A game a day" card are mini-games I created in a single day, as some sort of challenge. "Game Jam" are the two entries I did in the GMTK GameJam for 2019 and 2020. Both Prototype cards are mostly rather unfinished projects of varying amount of work put into them, where I tried out small ideas, mostly for games.<br><br>
