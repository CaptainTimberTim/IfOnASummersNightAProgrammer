				<h1>Unity Prototypes</h1><h2>These are some prototypes of games I made in Unity, which did not really go anywhere. But are at least a bit interesting.</h2><br><br>

					<td><h2>Polytamino - Game Prototype</h2>
					<h3>In this prototype you have two balls you can shoot. One that can spawn a Polytamino, a randomly generated shape, when you press a button and the other deletes a Polytamino when hitting it. The polytamino shapes are Unity standard cubes spawned one after another on a random side of an existing cube. Creating a strange shape. The clue is that the player can control the color of the spawning ball with the three color channels (red/green/blue) to manipulate certain randomization parameters. Green, for instance, controls the propability on how likely it is that the next spawned cube will choose the same side as the previous one. Blue controls the amount of "heads" on which the cubes are attached, etc. <br>The thing is, I never had an idea how to make an interesting game out of this.</h3></td>

					<td><h2>HexIt - Hex-Map-Builder Prototype</h2>
					<h3>This is a port of the hex map prototype I did in C/C++ with additional features. The editing mode is more sophisticated, as you can delete and raise the hex spaces to make the map more interesing. It additionally already has a character which can follow a given path. <br>The idea was to try making the hex map again in Unity to be able to work much faster, as I did not have all the fancy engine stuff in C++. But I somehow lost motivation again for this project and since then it is in stasis. I may get back to it someday.</h3></td>

					<td><h2>Gears - Game Prototype</h2>
					<h3>These are the foundations of a puzzle game. It was initially inspired by the Zachtronics games, but is more like a standard -solve this puzzle- game at this point. The idea is that the player has to assemble gears and other stuff to bring a production machine back online. This can be done by dragging the gears onto poles and connecting them.<br>One thing about this prototype is that everything is generated at runtime with standard primitives from unity. The gears, the conveyer belt and everything else are cylinders and cubes positioned and animated by code. Additionally, all elements have debug-line representations in the Unity editor to be able to build levels.<br> But similar to the other prototypes, I lost motivation at some point and did not really get even a small game finished.</h3></td>
